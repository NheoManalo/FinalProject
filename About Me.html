                    <h2>Nheo Manalo</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was born in December 26, 2003 in Batangas City. My parents named 
                        me Nheo Manalo as they named me after a character from a movie 
                        called “The Matrix”. My father's name is Lorenzo B. Manalo and my 
                        Mother's name is Elsie Fe P. Manalo.
                        <br><br>
                        I started school at the age of 4. We moved from Batangas to Manila 3 
                        years later and studied at Aurora A. Quezon Elementary School in my 
                        primary school days. After graduating I enrolled in Adamson University 
                        in my JHS to SHS days</p>
